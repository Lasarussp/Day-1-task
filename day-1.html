3.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


Objects its most important data-type and forms the building block for modern javascript
objects different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
 primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 

Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal;

let bike = {name: 'Bajaj', brand:'Ns 200', engine:'198.99cc'};

Create JavaScript Object with Constructor;

 Create a constructor to provide the key values;

-->  function Vehicle(name, brand) {
       this.name = name;
       this.brand = brand;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle("acent", "Ford");
let car2 = new Vehicle("Santro", "Hyundai")
console.log(car1.name);    //Output: acent
console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santro
